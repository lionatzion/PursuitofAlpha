realtime_sentiment_fundamental.py

This script is a scaffold for real-time analysis that can incorporate outputs from multiple modules:
- Market sentiment (e.g., news, social media, NLP models)
- Fundamental analysis (e.g., financial ratios, earnings, macro data)
- Technical signals (optional)

It is designed to be extended for live data feeds and real-time decision making.
