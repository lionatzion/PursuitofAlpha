# Pursuit of Alpha

This project aims to pursue Alpha (excess returns) by implementing robust **backtesting** frameworks and **regression analysis** techniques in Python.

## Goals

- **Backtest** trading strategies to evaluate their historical performance.
- Utilize **regression analysis** to identify and optimize factors that contribute to Alpha.
- Continuously add, refine, and perfect the methodologies and equations used for analysis.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement core backtesting engine.
- [ ] Add regression and factor analysis modules.
- [ ] Integrate data sources for historical pricing and fundamental information.
- [ ] Design experiments to optimize for Alpha.
- [ ] Document and visualize results for ongoing improvement.

_This repository will be constantly updated as new features, equations, and improvements are developed._
